"The interface is based on a memory area shared between hypervisor and VM. "
"The memory area is obtained by driver as a device IO memory resource of "
"``PVSCSI_MEM_SPACE_SIZE`` length. The shared memory consists of a registers "
"area and a rings area. The registers area is used to raise hypervisor "
"interrupts and issue device commands. The rings area is used to transfer "
"data descriptors and SCSI commands from VM to hypervisor and to transfer "
"messages produced by hypervisor to VM. Data itself is transferred via "
"virtual scatter-gather DMA."
