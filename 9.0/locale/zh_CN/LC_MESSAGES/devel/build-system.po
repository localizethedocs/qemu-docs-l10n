"An important step in ``configure`` is to create a Python virtual environment "
"(venv) during the configuration phase.  The Python interpreter comes from "

"environment, or the system PATH, in this order.  The venv resides in the "

"build process runs Python code."

"At this stage, ``configure`` also queries the chosen Python interpreter "
"about QEMU's build dependencies.  Note that the build process does  *not* "
"look for ``meson``, ``sphinx-build`` or ``avocado`` binaries in the PATH; "
"likewise, there are no options such as ``--meson`` or ``--sphinx-build``. "
"This avoids a potential mismatch, where Meson and Sphinx binaries on the "
"PATH might operate in a different Python environment than the one chosen by "
"the user during the build process.  On the other hand, it introduces a "
"potential source of confusion where the user installs a dependency but "
"``configure`` is not able to find it.  When this happens, the dependency was "
"installed in the ``site-packages`` directory of another interpreter, or with "
"the wrong ``pip`` program."
msgstr ""

"If a package is available for the chosen interpreter, ``configure`` prepares "
"a small script that invokes it from the venv itself[#distlib]_. If not, "
"``configure`` can also optionally install dependencies in the virtual "
"environment with ``pip``, either from wheels in ``python/wheels`` or by "
"downloading the package with PyPI.  Downloading can be disabled with ``--"

"The scripts are created based on the package's metadata, specifically the "

"to use ``python -m`` instead of an entry point script, which makes this "
"approach a bit overkill.  On the other hand, creating the scripts is future "
"proof and it makes the contents of the ``pyvenv/bin`` directory more "
"informative.  Portability is also not an issue, because the Python Packaging "
"Authority provides a package ``distlib.scripts`` to perform this task."
