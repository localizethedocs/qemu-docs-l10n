"While QEMU itself uses QMP as primary IPC (and Spice/VNC for remote "

"Using a bus, helper processes can discover and communicate with each other "
"easily, without going through QEMU. The bus topology is also easier to "

"The daemon can control which peers can send/recv messages using various "
"metadata attributes, however, this is alone is not generally sufficient to "
"make the deployment secure.  The semantics of the actual methods implemented "
"using D-Bus are just as critical. Peers need to carefully validate any "
"information they received from a peer with a different trust level."
