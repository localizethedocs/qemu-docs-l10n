msgid ""
"Semihosting is a feature defined by the owner of the architecture to allow "
"programs to interact with a debugging host system. On real hardware this is "
"usually provided by an In-circuit emulator (ICE) hooked directly to the "
"board. QEMU's implementation allows for semihosting calls to be passed to "
"the host system or via the ``gdbstub``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../about/emulation.rst:117
msgid ""
"Generally semihosting makes it easier to bring up low level code before a "
"more fully functional operating system has been enabled. On QEMU it also "
"allows for embedded micro-controller code which typically doesn't have a "
"full libc to be run as \"bare-metal\" code under QEMU's user-mode emulation. "
"It is also useful for writing test cases and indeed a number of compiler "
"suites as well as QEMU itself use semihosting calls to exit test code while "
"reporting the success state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../about/emulation.rst:125
msgid ""
"Semihosting is only available using TCG emulation. This is because the "
"instructions to trigger a semihosting call are typically reserved causing "
"most hypervisors to trap and fault on them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../about/emulation.rst:130
msgid ""
"Semihosting inherently bypasses any isolation there may be between the guest "
"and the host. As a result a program using semihosting can happily trash your "
"host system. Some semihosting calls (e.g. ``SYS_READC``) can block execution "
"indefinitely. You should only ever run trusted code with semihosting enabled."

"Semihosting calls can be re-directed to a (potentially remote) gdb during "

msgid ""
"Most targets offer similar semihosting implementations with some minor "
"changes to define the appropriate instruction to encode the semihosting call "
"and which registers hold the parameters. They tend to presents a simple "
"POSIX-like API which allows your program to read and write files, access the "
"console and some other basic interactions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../about/emulation.rst:154

"For full details of the ABI for a particular target, and the set of calls it "

"architecture."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../about/emulation.rst:159
msgid ""
"QEMU makes an implementation decision to implement all file access in "
"``O_BINARY`` mode. The user-visible effect of this is regardless of the text/"
"binary mode the program sets QEMU will always select a binary mode ensuring "
"no line-terminator conversion is performed on input or output. This is "
"because gdb semihosting support doesn't make the distinction between the "
"modes and magically processing line endings can be confusing."
