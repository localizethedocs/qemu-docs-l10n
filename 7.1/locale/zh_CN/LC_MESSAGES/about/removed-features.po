"suboptiomal performance. However since 2014 there is an alternative way to "

"``mem`` and adds means to actually manage node RAM on the host side. Use "
"parameter ``memdev`` with *memory-backend-ram* backend as replacement for "
"parameter ``mem`` to achieve the same fake NUMA effect or a properly "
"configured *memory-backend-file* backend to actually benefit from NUMA "
"configuration. New machine versions (since 5.1) will not accept the option "

"to preserve the same RAM distribution, should configure it explicitly using "
"``-numa node,memdev`` options. Current RAM distribution can be retrieved "
