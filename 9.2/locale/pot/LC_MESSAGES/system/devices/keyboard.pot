"SUN Type 4, 5 and 5c keyboards have dip switches to choose the language "
"layout of the keyboard. Solaris makes an ioctl to query the value of the "
"dipswitches and uses that value to select keyboard layout. Also the SUN bios "
"like the one in the file ss5.bin uses this value to support at least some "
"keyboard layouts. However, the OpenBIOS provided with qemu is hardcoded to "
"always use an US keyboard layout."
