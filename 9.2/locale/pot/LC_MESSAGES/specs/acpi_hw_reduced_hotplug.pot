"The ACPI *Generic Event Device* (GED) is a HW reduced platform specific "
"device introduced in ACPI v6.1 that handles all platform events, including "
"the hotplug ones. GED is modelled as a device in the namespace with a _HID "
"defined to be ACPI0013. This document describes the interface between QEMU "
"and the ACPI BIOS."

"GED allows HW reduced platforms to handle interrupts in ACPI ASL statements. "
"It follows a very similar approach to the _EVT method from GPIO events. All "
"interrupts are listed in  _CRS and the handler is written in _EVT method. "
"However, the QEMU implementation uses a single interrupt for the GED device, "
"relying on an IO memory region to communicate the type of device affected by "
"the interrupt. This way, we can support up to 32 events with a unique "
"interrupt."
