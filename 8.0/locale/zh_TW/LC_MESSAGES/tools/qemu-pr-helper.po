"SCSI persistent reservations allow restricting access to block devices to "
"specific initiators in a shared storage setup.  When implementing clustering "
"of virtual machines, it is a common requirement for virtual machines to send "
"persistent reservation SCSI commands.  However, the operating system "
"restricts sending these commands to unprivileged programs because incorrect "
"usage can disrupt regular operation of the storage fabric. QEMU's SCSI "
"passthrough devices ``scsi-block`` and ``scsi-generic`` support passing "
"guest persistent reservation requests to a privileged external helper "
"program. :program:`qemu-pr-helper` is that external helper; it creates a "
"listener socket which will accept incoming connections for communication "
"with QEMU."

"If you want to run VMs in a setup like this, this helper should be started "
