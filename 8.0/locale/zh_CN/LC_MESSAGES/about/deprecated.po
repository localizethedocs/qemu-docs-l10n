"In general features are intended to be supported indefinitely once "

"will be listed in this section. The feature will remain functional for the "
"release in which it was deprecated and one further release. After these two "
"releases, the feature is liable to be removed. Deprecated features may also "
"generate warnings on the console when QEMU starts up, or if activated via a "
"monitor command, however, this is not a mandatory requirement."
