"To overcome above issues, following approach is used: A new filesystem type "
"'proxy' is introduced. Proxy FS uses chroot + socket combination for "
"securing the vulnerability known with following symbolic links. Intention of "
"adding a new filesystem type is to allow qemu to run in non-root mode, but "
"doing privileged operations using socket IO."

"Proxy helper (a stand alone binary part of qemu) is invoked with root "
"privileges. Proxy helper chroots into 9p export path and creates a socket "
"pair or a named socket based on the command line parameter. QEMU and proxy "
"helper communicate using this socket. QEMU proxy fs driver sends filesystem "
"request to proxy helper and receives the response from it."
