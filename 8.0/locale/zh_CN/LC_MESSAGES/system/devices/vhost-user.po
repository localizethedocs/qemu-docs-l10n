"These are simple stub devices that ensure the VirtIO device is visible to "
"the guest. The code is mostly boilerplate although each device has a "
"``chardev`` option which specifies the ID of the ``--chardev`` device that "
"connects via a socket to the vhost-user *daemon*."

"This is a separate process that is connected to by QEMU via a socket "
"following the :ref:`vhost_user_proto`. There are a number of daemons that "
"can be built when enabled by the project although any daemon that meets the "
"specification for a given device can be used."

"In order for the daemon to access the VirtIO queues to process the requests "
"it needs access to the guest's address space. This is achieved via the "
"``memory-backend-file`` or ``memory-backend-memfd`` objects. A reference to "
"a file-descriptor which can access this object will be passed via the socket "
"as part of the protocol negotiation."
