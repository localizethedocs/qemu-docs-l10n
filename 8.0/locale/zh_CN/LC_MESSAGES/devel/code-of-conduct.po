"The QEMU community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers "
"from all over the world. Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can also "
"lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few "
"ground rules that we ask people to adhere to."

"Be welcoming. We are committed to making participation in this project a "
"harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, "
"gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, "

"Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time.  Disagreements, both "
"social and technical, happen all the time and the QEMU community is no "
"exception. When we disagree, we try to understand why.  It is important that "
"we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.  Members of the "
"QEMU community should be respectful when dealing with other contributors as "
"well as with people outside the QEMU community and with users of QEMU."
