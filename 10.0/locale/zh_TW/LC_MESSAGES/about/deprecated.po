"In general features are intended to be supported indefinitely once "

"will be listed in this section. The feature will remain functional for the "
"release in which it was deprecated and one further release. After these two "
"releases, the feature is liable to be removed. Deprecated features may also "
"generate warnings on the console when QEMU starts up, or if activated via a "
"monitor command, however, this is not a mandatory requirement."

"As a special exception to this general timeframe, rather than have an "

"versioned machine types will be automatically marked deprecated after an "
"initial 3 years (9 QEMU releases) has passed, and will then be deleted after "
"a further 3 year period has passed. It is recommended that a deprecated "
"machine type is only used for incoming migrations and restore of saved "
"state, for pre-existing VM deployments. They should be scheduled for "
"updating to a newer machine type during an appropriate service window. Newly "
"deployed VMs should exclusively use a non-deprecated machine type, with use "
"of the most recent version highly recommended. Non-versioned machine types "
