"Conflicts in the community can take many forms, from someone having a bad "
"day and using harsh and hurtful language on the mailing list to more serious "
"code of conduct violations (including sexist/racist statements or threats of "
"violence), and everything in between."

"For the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first "
"resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after "
"that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over "
"the outcome of their dispute."

"If you are experiencing conflict, please consider first addressing the "
"perceived conflict directly with other involved parties, preferably through "
"a real-time medium such as IRC. You could also try to get a third-party (e."
"g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not "
"involved in the conflict) to intercede or mediate."

"If this fails or if you do not feel comfortable proceeding this way, or if "
"the problem requires immediate escalation, report the issue to the QEMU "
"leadership committee by sending an email to qemu@sfconservancy.org, "
"providing references to the misconduct. For very urgent topics, you can also "
"inform one or more members through IRC. The up-to-date list of members is "
"`available on the QEMU wiki <https://wiki.qemu.org/Conservancy>`__."

"Your report will be treated confidentially by the leadership committee and "

"A public reprimand plus a mandatory cooling off period. The cooling off "
"period may require, for example, one or more of the following: abstaining "
"from maintainer duties; not interacting with people involved, including "
