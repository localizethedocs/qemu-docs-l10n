"QEMU can emulate z/Architecture (in particular, 64 bit) s390x systems via "
"the ``qemu-system-s390x`` binary. Only one machine type, ``s390-ccw-"

"When using KVM as accelerator, QEMU can emulate CPUs up to the generation of "
"the host. When using the default cpu model with TCG as accelerator, QEMU "
"will emulate a subset of z13 cpu features that should be enough to run "
"distributions built for the z13."
