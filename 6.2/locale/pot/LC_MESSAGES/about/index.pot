"QEMU can be used in several different ways. The most common is for \"system "
"emulation\", where it provides a virtual model of an entire machine (CPU, "
"memory and emulated devices) to run a guest OS. In this mode the CPU may be "
"fully emulated, or it may work with a hypervisor such as KVM, Xen, Hax or "
"Hypervisor.Framework to allow the guest to run directly on the host CPU."

"The second supported way to use QEMU is \"user mode emulation\", where QEMU "
"can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. In this mode the "
"CPU is always emulated."

"QEMU also provides a number of standalone commandline utilities, such as the "
"``qemu-img`` disk image utility that allows you to create, convert and "
"modify disk images."
