"SCSI persistent reservations allow restricting access to block devices to "
"specific initiators in a shared storage setup.  When implementing clustering "
"of virtual machines, it is a common requirement for virtual machines to send "
"persistent reservation SCSI commands.  However, the operating system "
"restricts sending these commands to unprivileged programs because incorrect "
"usage can disrupt regular operation of the storage fabric."

"For this reason, QEMU's SCSI passthrough devices, ``scsi-block`` and ``scsi-"
"generic`` (both are only available on Linux) can delegate implementation of "
"persistent reservations to a separate object, the \"persistent reservation "
"manager\".  Only PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT and PERSISTENT RESERVE IN commands "
"are passed to the persistent reservation manager object; other commands are "
"processed by QEMU as usual."

"Right now only one subclass is defined, ``pr-manager-helper``, which "
"forwards the commands to an external privileged helper program over Unix "
"sockets.  The helper program only allows sending persistent reservation "
"commands to devices for which QEMU has a file descriptor, so that QEMU will "
"not be able to effect persistent reservations unless it has access to both "
"the socket and the device."

"``pr-manager-helper`` has a single string property, ``path``, which accepts "
"the path to the helper program's Unix socket.  For example, the following "
"command line defines a ``pr-manager-helper`` object and attaches it to a "
"SCSI passthrough device::"
