"Users should be aware the above example elides a lot of the complexity of "
"setting up a VM with x86_64 specific defaults and assumes the first non "
"switch argument is a PC compatible disk image with a boot sector. For a non-"
"x86 system where we emulate a broad range of machine types, the command "
"lines are generally more explicit in defining the machine and boot "
"behaviour. You will find more example command lines in the :ref:`system-"
"targets-ref` section of the manual."
