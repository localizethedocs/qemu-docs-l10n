"This specification contains minimal information about Parallels Disk Format, "
"which is enough to properly work with QEMU. Nevertheless, Parallels Cloud "
"Server and Parallels Desktop are able to add some unspecified nodes to the "
"xml and use them, but they are for internal work and don't affect "
"functionality. Also it uses auxiliary xml ``Snapshot.xml``, which allows "
"storage of optional snapshot information, but this doesn't influence open/"
"read/write functionality. QEMU and other software should not use fields not "
"covered in this document or the ``Snapshot.xml`` file, and must leave them "
"as is."
