"``qemu-storage-daemon`` provides disk image functionality from QEMU, ``qemu-"
"img``, and ``qemu-nbd`` in a long-running process controlled via QMP "
"commands without running a virtual machine. It can export disk images, run "
"block job operations, and perform other disk-related operations. The daemon "
"is controlled via a QMP monitor and initial configuration from the command-"
"line."
