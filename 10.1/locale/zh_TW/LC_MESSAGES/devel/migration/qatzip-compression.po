"In scenarios with limited network bandwidth, the ``QATzip`` solution can "
"help users save a lot of host CPU resources by accelerating compression and "

"The following test was conducted using 8 multifd channels and 10Gbps network "
"bandwidth. The results show that, compared to zstd, ``QATzip`` significantly "
"saves CPU resources on the sender and reduces migration time. Compared to "
"the uncompressed solution, ``QATzip`` greatly improves the dirty page "
"processing capability, indicated by the Pages per Second metric, and also "
"reduces the total migration time."
