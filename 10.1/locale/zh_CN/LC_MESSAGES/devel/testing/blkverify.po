"This document describes how to use the ``blkverify`` protocol to test that a "
"block driver is operating correctly."

msgid ""
"It is difficult to test and debug block drivers against real guests.  Often "
"processes inside the guest will crash because corrupt sectors were read as "
"part of the executable.  Other times obscure errors are raised by a program "
"inside the guest.  These issues are extremely hard to trace back to bugs in "
"the block driver."

"``blkverify`` solves this problem by catching data corruption inside QEMU "
"the first time bad data is read and reporting the disk sector that is "
"corrupted."

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/testing/blkverify.rst:22
msgid ""
"The ``blkverify`` protocol has two child block devices, the \"test\" device "
"and the \"raw\" device.  Read/write operations are mirrored to both devices "
"so their state should always be in sync."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/testing/blkverify.rst:26
msgid ""
"The \"raw\" device is a raw image, a flat file, that has identical starting "
"contents to the \"test\" image.  The idea is that the \"raw\" device will "
"handle read/write operations correctly and not corrupt data.  It can be used "
"as a reference for comparison against the \"test\" device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/testing/blkverify.rst:31
msgid ""
"After a mirrored read operation completes, ``blkverify`` will compare the "
"data and raise an error if it is not identical.  This makes it possible to "
"catch the first instance where corrupt data is read."
