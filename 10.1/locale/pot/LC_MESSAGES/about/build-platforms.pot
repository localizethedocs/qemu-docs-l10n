"QEMU aims to support building and executing on multiple host OS platforms. "
"This appendix outlines which platforms are the major build targets. These "
"platforms are used as the basis for deciding upon the minimum required "
"versions of 3rd party software QEMU depends on. The supported platforms are "
"the targets for automated testing performed by the project when patches are "
"submitted for review, and tested before and after merge."

"Note that when considering software versions shipped in distros as support "
"targets, QEMU considers only the version number, and assumes the features in "
"that distro match the upstream release with the same version. In other "
"words, if a distro backports extra features to the software in their distro, "
"QEMU upstream code will not add explicit support for those backports, unless "
"the feature is auto-detectable in a manner that works for the upstream "
"releases too."

"QEMU involves some Python scripts that call os.symlink() which needs special "
"attention for the build process to successfully complete. On newer versions "
