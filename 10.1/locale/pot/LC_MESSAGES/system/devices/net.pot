"QEMU can simulate several network cards (e.g. PCI or ISA cards on the PC "
"target) and can connect them to a network backend on the host or an emulated "
"hub. The various host network backends can either be used to connect the NIC "
"of the guest to a real network (e.g. by using a TAP devices or the non-"
"privileged user mode network stack), or to other guest instances running in "
