"The QAPI Domain itself provides no mechanisms for reading the QAPI Schema or "
"generating documentation from code that exists. It is merely the rST syntax "
"used to describe things. For instance, the Sphinx Python domain adds syntax "
"like ``:py:func:`` for describing Python functions in documentation, but "
"it's the autodoc module that is responsible for reading Python code and "
"generating such syntax. QAPI is analogous here: qapidoc.py is responsible "
"for reading the QAPI Schema and generating rST syntax, and qapi_domain.py is "
"responsible for translating that special syntax and providing APIs for "
"Sphinx internals."
