"The POWER9 processor comes with a new interrupt controller architecture, "
"called XIVE as \"eXternal Interrupt Virtualization Engine\"."

"Compared to the previous architecture, the main characteristics of XIVE are "
"to support a larger number of interrupt sources and to deliver interrupts "
"directly to virtual processors without hypervisor assistance. This removes "
"the context switches required for the delivery process."
