"SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is an optional extended capability "
"of a PCI Express device. It allows a single physical function (PF) to appear "
"as multiple virtual functions (VFs) for the main purpose of eliminating "
"software overhead in I/O from virtual machines."

"There are devices with predefined SR-IOV configurations, but it is also "
"possible to compose an SR-IOV device yourself. Composing an SR-IOV device is "
"currently only supported by virtio-net-pci."

"Users can configure an SR-IOV-capable virtio-net device by adding virtio-net-"
"pci functions to a bus. Below is a command line example:"

"The VFs specify the paired PF with ``sriov-pf`` property. The PF must be "
"added after all VFs. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that VFs have "
"function numbers larger than one of the PF, and that the function numbers "
"have a consistent stride. Both the PF and VFs are ARI-capable so you can "
"have 255 VFs at maximum."
