"In general features are intended to be supported indefinitely once "

"will be listed in this section. The feature will remain functional for the "
"release in which it was deprecated and one further release. After these two "
"releases, the feature is liable to be removed. Deprecated features may also "
"generate warnings on the console when QEMU starts up, or if activated via a "
"monitor command, however, this is not a mandatory requirement."

"As a special exception to this general timeframe, rather than have an "
"indefinite lifetime, versioned machine types are only intended to be "
"supported for a period of 6 years, equivalent to 18 QEMU releases. All "
"versioned machine types will be automatically marked deprecated after an "
"initial 3 years (9 QEMU releases) has passed, and will then be deleted after "
"a further 3 year period has passed. It is recommended that a deprecated "
"machine type is only used for incoming migrations and restore of saved "
"state, for pre-existing VM deployments. They should be scheduled for "
"updating to a newer machine type during an appropriate service window. Newly "
"deployed VMs should exclusively use a non-deprecated machine type, with use "
"of the most recent version highly recommended. Non-versioned machine types "

"The \"riscv,delegate\" DT property was added in QEMU 7.0 as part of the AIA "
"APLIC support.  The property changed name during the review process in Linux "
"and the correct name ended up being \"riscv,delegation\".  Changing the DT "
"property name will break all available firmwares that are using the current "
"(wrong) name.  The property is kept as is in 9.1, together with \"riscv,"
"delegation\", to give more time for firmware developers to change their code."

"The ``fd:`` URI can currently provide a file descriptor that references "
"either a socket or a plain file. These are two different types of migration. "
"In order to reduce ambiguity, the ``fd:`` URI usage of providing a file "
"descriptor to a plain file has been deprecated in favor of explicitly using "
"the ``file:`` URI with the file descriptor being passed as an ``fdset``. "
"Refer to the ``add-fd`` command documentation for details on the ``fdset`` "
