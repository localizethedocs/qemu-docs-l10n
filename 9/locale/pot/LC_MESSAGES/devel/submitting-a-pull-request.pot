"QEMU welcomes contributions of code, but we generally expect these to be "
"sent as simple patch emails to the mailing list (see our page on :ref:"
"`submitting-a-patch` for more details).  Generally only existing "
"submaintainers of a tree will need to submit pull requests, although "
"occasionally for a large patch series we might ask a submitter to send a "
"pull request. This page documents our recommendations on pull requests for "
"those people."

"**Resend the patches with the pull request** as emails which are threaded as "
"follow-ups to the pull request itself. The simplest way to do this is to use "
"``git format-patch --cover-letter`` to create the emails, and then edit the "
"cover letter to include the pull request details that ``git request-pull`` "
"outputs."

"**Use PULL as the subject line tag** in both the cover letter and the "
"retransmitted patch mails (for example, by using ``--subject-prefix=PULL`` "
"in your ``git format-patch`` command). This helps people to filter in or out "
"the resulting emails (especially useful if they are only CC'd on one email "
"out of the set)."

"**Each patch must have your own Signed-off-by: line** as well as that of the "
"original author if the patch was not written by you. This is because with a "
"pull request you're now indicating that the patch has passed via you rather "
"than directly from the original author."

"**Don't forget to add Reviewed-by: and Acked-by: lines**. When other people "
"have reviewed the patches you're putting in the pull request, make sure "
"you've copied their signoffs across. (If you use the `patches tool <https://"
"github.com/stefanha/patches>`__ to add patches from email directly to your "
"git repo it will include the tags automatically; if you're updating patches "
"manually or in some other way you'll need to edit the commit messages by "
"hand.)"

"**Don't send pull requests for code that hasn't passed review**. A pull "
"request says these patches are ready to go into QEMU now, so they must have "
"passed the standard code review processes. In particular if you've corrected "
"issues in one round of code review, you need to send your fixed patch series "
"as normal to the list; you can't put it in a pull request until it's gone "
"through. (Extremely trivial fixes may be OK to just fix in passing, but if "
"in doubt err on the side of not.)"

"**Test before sending**. This is an obvious thing to say, but make sure "
"everything builds (including that it compiles at each step of the patch "
"series) and that \"make check\" passes before sending out the pull request. "
"As a submaintainer you're one of QEMU's lines of defense against bad code, "
"so double check the details."

"**All pull requests must be signed**. By \"signed\" here we mean that the "

"'gpg tag -s ...'). See :ref:`maintainer_keys` for details."

"**Pull requests not for master should say \"not for master\" and have \"PULL "
"SUBSYSTEM whatever\" in the subject tag**. If your pull request is targeting "
"a stable branch or some submaintainer tree, please include the string \"not "
"for master\" in the cover letter email, and make sure the subject tag is "
"\"PULL SUBSYSTEM s390/block/whatever\" rather than just \"PULL\". This "
"allows it to be automatically filtered out of the set of pull requests that "
"should be applied to master."
