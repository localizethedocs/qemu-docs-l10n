"pvpanic device is a simulated device, through which a guest panic event is "
"sent to qemu, and a QMP event is generated. This allows management apps (e."
"g. libvirt) to be notified and respond to the event."

"The management app has the option of waiting for GUEST_PANICKED events, and/"

"fired a panic event."
