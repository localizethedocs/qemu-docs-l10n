"Traditionally, hypervisors such as QEMU have complete access to a guest's "
"memory and other state, meaning that a compromised hypervisor can compromise "
"any of its guests.  A number of platforms have added mechanisms in hardware "
"and/or firmware which give guests at least some protection from a "
"compromised hypervisor.  This is obviously especially desirable for public "
"cloud environments."

"These mechanisms have different names and different modes of operation, but "
"are often referred to as Secure Guests or Confidential Guests.  We use the "
"term \"Confidential Guest Support\" to distinguish this from other aspects "
"of guest security (such as security against attacks from other guests, or "
"from network sources)."
