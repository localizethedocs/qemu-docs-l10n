#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:9

"This interface allows objects to be grouped (on a tree basis); so that the "
"whole group can be reset consistently. Each individual member object does "
"not have to care about others; in particular, problems of order (which "
"object is reset first) are addressed."

"should use to control it. All resettable control functions must be called "
"while holding the iothread lock."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:24
msgid ""
"You can apply a reset to an object using ``resettable_assert_reset()``. You "
"need to call ``resettable_release_reset()`` to release the object from "
"reset. To instantly reset an object, without keeping it in reset state, just "
"call ``resettable_reset()``. These functions take two parameters: a pointer "
"to the object to reset and a reset type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:30

"Several types of reset will be supported. For now only cold reset is "
"defined; others may be added later. The Resettable interface handles reset "
"types with an enum:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:35
msgid ""
"Cold reset is supported by every resettable object. In QEMU, it means we "
"reset to the initial state corresponding to the start of QEMU; this might "
"differ from what is a real hardware cold reset. It differs from other resets "
"(like warm or bus resets) which may keep certain parts untouched."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:40
msgid ""
"Calling ``resettable_reset()`` is equivalent to calling "
"``resettable_assert_reset()`` then ``resettable_release_reset()``. It is "
"possible to interleave multiple calls to these three functions. There may be "
"several reset sources/controllers of a given object. The interface handles "
"everything and the different reset controllers do not need to know anything "
"about each others. The object will leave reset state only when each other "
"controllers end their reset operation. This point is handled internally by "
"maintaining a count of in-progress resets; it is crucial to call "
"``resettable_release_reset()`` one time and only one time per "
"``resettable_assert_reset()`` call."
msgstr ""

"For now migration of a device or bus in reset is not supported. Care must be "
"taken not to delay ``resettable_release_reset()`` after its "
"``resettable_assert_reset()`` counterpart."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:55
msgid ""
"Note that, since resettable is an interface, the API takes a simple Object "
"as parameter. Still, it is a programming error to call a resettable function "
"on a non-resettable object and it will trigger a run time assert error. "
"Since most calls to resettable interface are done through base class "
"functions, such an error is not likely to happen."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:70
msgid ""
"Device and bus functions co-exist because there can be semantic differences "
"between resetting a bus and resetting the controller bridge which owns it. "
"For example, consider a SCSI controller. Resetting the controller puts all "
"its registers back to what reset state was as well as reset everything on "
"the SCSI bus, whereas resetting just the SCSI bus only resets everything "
"that's on it but not the controller."

"The resettable interface uses a multi-phase system to relieve objects and "

"of an object is split into three well defined phases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:87
msgid ""
"When resetting several objects (for example the whole machine at simulation "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:93
msgid ""
"The **enter** phase is executed when the object enters reset. It resets only "
"local state of the object; it must not do anything that has a side-effect on "
"other objects, such as raising or lowering a qemu_irq line or reading or "
"writing guest memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:98
msgid ""
"The **hold** phase is executed for entry into reset, once every object in "

"point devices can do actions that affect other objects."

msgid ""
"The **exit** phase is executed when the object leaves the reset state. "
"Actions affecting other objects are permitted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/reset.rst:105
msgid ""
"As said in previous section, the interface maintains a count of reset. This "
"count is used to ensure phases are executed only when required. *enter* and "
"*hold* phases are executed only when asserting reset for the first time (if "
"an object is already in reset state when calling "
"``resettable_assert_reset()`` or ``resettable_reset()``, they are not "
"executed). The *exit* phase is executed only when the last reset operation "
"ends. Therefore the object does not need to care how many of reset "
"controllers it has and how many of them have started a reset."
