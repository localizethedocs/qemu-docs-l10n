"Specifies how to deal with multiple devices being shared with a 9p export. "

"accessed via the same 9p export then only a warning message is logged (once) "

"share the same device id on guest. So two files with identical inode numbers "
"but from actually different devices on host would otherwise cause a file ID "
"collision and hence potential misbehaviours on guest. \"forbid\" on the "
