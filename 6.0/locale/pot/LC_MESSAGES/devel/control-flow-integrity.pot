"CFI is a hardening technique that focusing on guaranteeing that indirect "
"function calls have not been altered by an attacker. The type used in QEMU "
"is a forward-edge control-flow integrity that ensures function calls "
"performed through function pointers, always call a \"compatible\" function. "
"A compatible function is a function with the same signature of the function "
"pointer declared in the source code."

"This type of CFI is entirely compiler-based and relies on the compiler "
"knowing the signature of every function and every function pointer used in "
"the code. As of now, the only compiler that provides support for CFI is "
