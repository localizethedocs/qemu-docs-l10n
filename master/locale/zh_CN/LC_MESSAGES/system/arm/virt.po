"The ``virt`` board is a platform which does not correspond to any real "
"hardware; it is designed for use in virtual machines. It is the recommended "

"This is a \"versioned\" board model, so as well as the ``virt`` machine type "
"itself (which may have improvements, bugfixes and other minor changes "
"between QEMU versions) a version is provided that guarantees to have the "
"same behaviour as that of previous QEMU releases, so that VM migration will "
"work between QEMU versions. For instance the ``virt-5.0`` machine type will "
"behave like the ``virt`` machine from the QEMU 5.0 release, and migration "
"should work between ``virt-5.0`` of the 5.0 release and ``virt-5.0`` of the "
