"Besides SD card emulation, QEMU also offers an eMMC model as found on many "
"embedded boards. An eMMC, just like an SD card, is connected to the machine "
"via an SDHCI controller."

"A recent eMMC consists of 4 partitions: 2 boot partitions, 1 Replay "
"protected Memory Block (RPMB), and the user data area. QEMU expects backing "
"images for the eMMC to contain those partitions concatenated in exactly that "
"order. However, the boot partitions as well as the RPMB might be absent if "
"their sizes are configured to zero."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../system/devices/emmc.rst:20
msgid ""
"The eMMC specification defines alignment constraints for the partitions. The "
"two boot partitions must be of the same size. Furthermore, boot and RPMB "
"partitions must be multiples of 128 KB with a maximum of 32640 KB for each "
"boot partition and 16384K for the RPMB partition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../system/devices/emmc.rst:25
msgid ""
"The alignment constrain of the user data area depends on its size. Up to 2 "
"GByte, the size must be a power of 2. From 2 GByte onward, the size has to "
"be multiples of 512 byte."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../system/devices/emmc.rst:29
msgid ""
"QEMU is enforcing those alignment rules before instantiating the device. "
"Therefore, the provided image has to strictly follow them as well. The "
"helper script ``scripts/mkemmc.sh`` can be used to create compliant images, "
"with or without pre-filled partitions. E.g., to create an eMMC image from a "
"firmware image and an OS image with an empty 2 MByte RPMB, use the following "
"command:"

"This will take care of rounding up the partition sizes to the next valid "
"value and will leave the RPMB and the second boot partition empty (zeroed)."

"An eMMC is either automatically created by a machine model (e.g. Aspeed "
"boards) or can be user-created when using a PCI-attached SDHCI controller. "
"To instantiate the eMMC image from the example above in a machine without "
"other SDHCI controllers while assuming that the firmware needs a boot "
"partitions of 1 MB, use the following options:"
