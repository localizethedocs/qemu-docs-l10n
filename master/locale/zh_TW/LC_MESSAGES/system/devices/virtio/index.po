"VirtIO devices are paravirtualized devices designed to be efficient to "
"emulate and virtualize. Unless you are specifically trying to exercise a "
"driver for some particular hardware they are the recommended device models "
"to use for virtual machines."

"The `VirtIO specification`_ is an open standard managed by OASIS. It "
"describes how a *driver* in a guest operating system interacts with the "
"*device* model provided by QEMU. Multiple Operating Systems support drivers "
"for VirtIO with Linux perhaps having the widest range of device types "
"supported."

"The device implementation can either be provided wholly by QEMU, or in "
"concert with the kernel (known as *vhost*). The device implementation can "
"also be off-loaded to an external process via :ref:`vhost user <vhost_user>`."
