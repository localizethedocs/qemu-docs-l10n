"There are a variety of objects in QEMU which require secret data to be "
"provided by the administrator or management application. For example, "
"network block devices often require a password, LUKS block devices require a "
"passphrase to unlock key material, remote desktop services require an access "
"password. QEMU has a general purpose mechanism for providing secret data to "
"QEMU in a secure manner, using the ``secret`` object type."

#: ../../../system/secrets.rst:13
msgid ""
"At startup this can be done using the ``-object secret,...`` command line "
"argument. At runtime this can be done using the ``object_add`` QMP / HMP "
"monitor commands. The examples that follow will illustrate use of ``-"
"object`` command lines, but they all apply equivalentely in QMP / HMP. When "
"creating a ``secret`` object it must be given a unique ID string. This ID is "
"then used to identify the object when configuring the thing which need the "
"data."

"**The following should never be done in a production environment or on a "
"multi-user host. Command line arguments are usually visible in the process "
"listings and are often collected in log files by system monitoring agents or "

"logged and attached to bug reports. This all risks compromising secrets that "

"The file should generally be given mode ``0600`` or ``0400`` permissions, "
