"QEMU provides a number of :ref:`vhost_user` daemons in the contrib "
"directory. They were often written when vhost-user was initially added to "
"the code base. You should also consider if other vhost-user daemons such as "
"those from the rust-vmm `vhost-device repository`_ are better suited for "
"production use."

"vhost-user-block is a backend for exposing block devices. It can present a "
"flat file or block device as a simple block device to the guest. You almost "
"certainly want to use the :ref:`storage-daemon` instead which supports a "
"wide variety of storage modes and exports a number of interfaces including "
"vhost-user."
