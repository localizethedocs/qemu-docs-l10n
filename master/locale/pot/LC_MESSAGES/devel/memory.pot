"Usually, regions may not overlap each other; a memory address decodes into "

"guest.  This is done with memory_region_add_subregion_overlap(), which "
"allows the region to overlap any other region in the same container, and "
"specifies a priority that allows the core to decide which of two regions at "
"the same address are visible (highest wins). Priority values are signed, and "
"the default value is zero. This means that you can use "
"memory_region_add_subregion_overlap() both to specify a region that must sit "

"that sits 'below' others (with a negative priority)."
