"QEMU uses a lot of dependencies on the host system a large number of which "
"are optional. At a minimum we expect to have a system C library (usually "
"glibc but others can work), the glib2 library (used heavily in the code "
"base) and a few other core libraries for interfacing with code modules and "
"system build descriptions."
