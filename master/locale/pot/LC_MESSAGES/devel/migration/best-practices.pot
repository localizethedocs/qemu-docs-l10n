"Migration migrates the copies of RAM and ROM, and thus when running on the "
"destination it includes the firmware from the source. Even after resetting a "
"VM, the old firmware is used.  Only once QEMU has been restarted is the new "
"firmware in use."

"Changes in firmware size can cause changes in the required RAMBlock size to "
"hold the firmware and thus migration can fail.  In practice it's best to pad "

"In some cases it may be best to tie specific firmware versions to specific "

"padding."
