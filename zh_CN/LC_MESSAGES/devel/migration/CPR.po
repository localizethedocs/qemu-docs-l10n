"CPR is the umbrella name for a set of migration modes in which the VM is "
"migrated to a new QEMU instance on the same host.  It is intended for use "
"when the goal is to update host software components that run the VM, such as "
"QEMU or even the host kernel.  At this time, the cpr-reboot and cpr-transfer "
"modes are available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/migration/CPR.rst:10
msgid ""
"Because QEMU is restarted on the same host, with access to the same local "
"devices, CPR is allowed in certain cases where normal migration would be "
"blocked.  However, the user must not modify the contents of guest block "
"devices between quitting old QEMU and starting new QEMU."

msgid ""
"In this mode, QEMU stops the VM, and writes VM state to the migration URI, "
"which will typically be a file.  After quitting QEMU, the user resumes by "
"running QEMU with the ``-incoming`` option.  Because the old and new QEMU "
"instances are not active concurrently, the URI cannot be a type that streams "
"data from one instance to the other."

"After state and memory are saved, the user may update userland host software "
"before restarting QEMU and resuming the VM.  Further, if the RAM is backed "

"This mode supports VFIO devices provided the user first puts the guest in "
"the suspended runstate, such as by issuing the ``guest-suspend-ram`` command "
"to the QEMU guest agent.  The agent must be pre-installed in the guest, and "
"the guest must support suspend to RAM.  Beware that suspension can take a "
"few seconds, so the user should poll to see the suspended state before "
"proceeding with the CPR operation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../devel/migration/CPR.rst:47
msgid ""
"It is recommended that guest RAM be backed with some type of shared memory, "
"such as ``memory-backend-file,share=on``, and that the ``x-ignore-shared`` "
"capability be set.  This combination allows memory to be saved in place.  "
"Otherwise, after QEMU stops the VM, all guest RAM is copied to the migration "
"URI."
