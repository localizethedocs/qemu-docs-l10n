"Almost all network services in QEMU have the ability to use TLS for session "
"data encryption, along with x509 certificates for simple client "

"Assuming that the QEMU network services will only ever be exposed to clients "
"on a private intranet, there is no need to use a commercial certificate "
"authority to create certificates. A self-signed CA is sufficient, and in "
"fact likely to be more secure since it removes the ability of malicious 3rd "
"parties to trick the CA into mis-issuing certs for impersonating your "
"services. The only likely exception where a commercial CA might be desirable "
"is if enabling the VNC websockets server and exposing it directly to remote "
"browser clients. In such a case it might be useful to use a commercial CA to "
"avoid needing to install custom CA certs in the web browsers."
