"Intel Trusted Domain eXtensions (TDX) refers to an Intel technology that "
"extends Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) and Multi-Key Total Memory "
"Encryption (MKTME) with a new kind of virtual machine guest called a Trust "
"Domain (TD). A TD runs in a CPU mode that is designed to protect the "
"confidentiality of its memory contents and its CPU state from any other "
"software, including the hosting Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), unless "
"explicitly shared by the TD itself."
