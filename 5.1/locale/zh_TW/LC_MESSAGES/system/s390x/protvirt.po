"Ultravisor, of specific IBM Z machines."

"control is transferred to one of the components (zipl stage3). Stage3 does "
"some fixups and then transfers control to some program residing in guest "

"Booting from the image supplied on the QEMU command line requires that the "

"is used, the command line options -initrd and -cmdline are ineffective. The "
"preparation of a PVM image is done via the `genprotimg` tool from the s390-"
"tools collection."
