"The QEMU dbus-vmstate object's aim is to migrate helpers' data running on a "
"QEMU D-Bus bus. (refer to the :doc:`dbus` document for some recommendations "
"on D-Bus usage)"

"Upon migration, QEMU will go through the queue of ``org.qemu.VMState1`` D-"
"Bus name owners and query their ``Id``. It must be unique among the helpers."

"It will then save arbitrary data of each Id to be transferred in the "
"migration stream and restored/loaded at the corresponding destination helper."

msgid ""
"For now, the data amount to be transferred is arbitrarily limited to 1Mb. "
"The state must be saved quickly (a fraction of a second). (D-Bus imposes a "
"time limit on reply anyway, and migration would fail if data isn't given "
"quickly enough.)"
