"QEMU supports working with gdb via gdb's remote-connection facility (the "
"\"gdbstub\"). This allows you to debug guest code in the same way that you "
"might with a low-level debug facility like JTAG on real hardware. You can "
"stop and start the virtual machine, examine state like registers and memory, "
"and set breakpoints and watchpoints."

"In order to use gdb, launch QEMU with the ``-s`` and ``-S`` options. The ``-"
"s`` option will make QEMU listen for an incoming connection from gdb on TCP "
"port 1234, and ``-S`` will make QEMU not start the guest until you tell it "
"to from gdb. (If you want to specify which TCP port to use or to use "
"something other than TCP for the gdbstub connection, use the ``-gdb dev`` "
"option instead of ``-s``. See `Using unix sockets`_ for an example.)"

msgid ""
"GDB's abstraction for debugging targets with multiple possible parallel "
"flows of execution is a two layer one: it supports multiple \"inferiors\", "
"each of which can have multiple \"threads\". When the QEMU machine has more "
"than one CPU, QEMU exposes each CPU cluster as a separate \"inferior\", "
"where each CPU within the cluster is a separate \"thread\". Most QEMU "
"machine types have identical CPUs, so there is a single cluster which has "
"all the CPUs in it.  A few machine types are heterogeneous and have multiple "
"clusters: for example the ``sifive_u`` machine has a cluster with one E51 "
"core and a second cluster with four U54 cores. Here the E51 is the only "
"thread in the first inferior, and the U54 cores are all threads in the "
"second inferior."

"or exception vectors instead of executing the current instruction. This "
"means you may hit the same breakpoint a number of times before executing the "
"instruction gdb wants to have executed. Because there are rare circumstances "
"where you want to single step into an interrupt vector the behavior can be "
