"While the ``virt`` board is a generic board platform that doesn't match any "
"real hardware the ``sbsa-ref`` board intends to look like real hardware. The "
"`Server Base System Architecture <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/"
"den0029/latest>`_ defines a minimum base line of hardware support and "
"importantly how the firmware reports that to any operating system. It is a "
"static system that reports a very minimal DT to the firmware for non-"
"discoverable information about components affected by the qemu command line "
"(i.e. cpus and memory). As a result it must have a firmware specifically "
"built to expect a certain hardware layout (as you would in a real machine)."
