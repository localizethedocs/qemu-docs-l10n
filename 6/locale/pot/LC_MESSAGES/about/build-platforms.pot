"QEMU aims to support building and executing on multiple host OS platforms. "
"This appendix outlines which platforms are the major build targets. These "
"platforms are used as the basis for deciding upon the minimum required "
"versions of 3rd party software QEMU depends on. The supported platforms are "
"the targets for automated testing performed by the project when patches are "
"submitted for review, and tested before and after merge."

"If a platform is not listed here, it does not imply that QEMU won't work. If "
"an unlisted platform has comparable software versions to a listed platform, "
"there is every expectation that it will work. Bug reports are welcome for "
"problems encountered on unlisted platforms unless they are clearly older "
"vintage than what is described here."

"Note that when considering software versions shipped in distros as support "
"targets, QEMU considers only the version number, and assumes the features in "
"that distro match the upstream release with the same version. In other "
"words, if a distro backports extra features to the software in their distro, "
"QEMU upstream code will not add explicit support for those backports, unless "
"the feature is auto-detectable in a manner that works for the upstream "
"releases too."
