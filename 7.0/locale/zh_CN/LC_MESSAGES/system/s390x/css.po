"QEMU implements a virtual channel subsystem with subchannels, (mostly "
"functionless) channel paths, and channel devices (virtio-ccw, 3270, and "
"devices passed via vfio-ccw). It supports multiple subchannel sets (MSS) and "
"multiple channel subsystems extended (MCSS-E)."

"All channel devices support the ``devno`` property, which takes a parameter "
"in the form ``<cssid>.<ssid>.<device number>``."

msgid ""
"The default channel subsystem image id (``<cssid>``) is ``0xfe``. Devices in "
"there will show up in channel subsystem image ``0`` to guests that do not "
"enable MCSS-E. Note that devices with a different cssid will not be visible "
"if the guest OS does not enable MCSS-E (which is true for all supported "
"guest operating systems today)."

"Supported values for the subchannel set id (``<ssid>``) range from ``0-3``. "
"Devices with a ssid that is not ``0`` will not be visible if the guest OS "
"does not enable MSS (any Linux version that supports virtio also enables "
"MSS). Any device may be put into any subchannel set, there is no restriction "
"by device type."

"QEMU places a device at the first free subchannel in the specified "
