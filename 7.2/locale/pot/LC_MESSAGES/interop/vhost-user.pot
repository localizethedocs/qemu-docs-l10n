"This protocol is aiming to complement the ``ioctl`` interface used to "
"control the vhost implementation in the Linux kernel. It implements the "
"control plane needed to establish virtqueue sharing with a user space "
"process on the same host. It uses communication over a Unix domain socket to "
"share file descriptors in the ancillary data of the message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The protocol defines 2 sides of the communication, *front-end* and *back-"
"end*. The *front-end* is the application that shares its virtqueues, in our "
"case QEMU. The *back-end* is the consumer of the virtqueues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../interop/vhost-user.rst:30
msgid ""
"In the current implementation QEMU is the *front-end*, and the *back-end* is "
"the external process consuming the virtio queues, for example a software "
"Ethernet switch running in user space, such as Snabbswitch, or a block "
"device back-end processing read & write to a virtual disk. In order to "
"facilitate interoperability between various back-end implementations, it is "
"recommended to follow the :ref:`Backend program conventions "
"<backend_conventions>`."
