"A lot of functions in QEMU block layer (see ``block/*``) can only be called "
"in coroutine context. Such functions are normally marked by the coroutine_fn "
"specifier. Still, sometimes we need to call them from non-coroutine context; "
"for this we need to start a coroutine, run the needed function from it and "
"wait for the coroutine to finish in a BDRV_POLL_WHILE() loop. To run a "
"coroutine we need a function with one void* argument. So for each "
"coroutine_fn function which needs a non-coroutine interface, we should "
"define a structure to pack the parameters, define a separate function to "
"unpack the parameters and call the original function and finally define a "
"new interface function with same list of arguments as original one, which "
"will pack the parameters into a struct, create a coroutine, run it and wait "
"in BDRV_POLL_WHILE() loop. It's boring to create such wrappers by hand, so "
"we have a script to generate them."
