"Biosbits is a software written by Josh Triplett that can be downloaded from "
"https://biosbits.org/. The github codebase can be found `here <https://"
"github.com/biosbits/bits/tree/master>`__. It is a software that executes the "
"bios components such as acpi and smbios tables directly through acpica bios "
"interpreter (a freely available C based library written by Intel, "
"downloadable from https://acpica.org/ and is included with biosbits) without "
"an operating system getting involved in between. There are several "
"advantages to directly testing the bios in a real physical machine or VM as "
"opposed to indirectly discovering bios issues through the operating system. "
"For one thing, the OSes tend to hide bios problems from the end user. The "
"other is that we have more control of what we wanted to test and how by "
"directly using acpica interpreter on top of the bios on a running system. "
"More details on the inspiration for developing biosbits and its real life "
"uses can be found in [#a]_ and [#b]_. For QEMU, we maintain a fork of bios "
"bits in gitlab along with all the dependent submodules here: https://gitlab."
"com/qemu-project/biosbits-bits This fork contains numerous fixes, a newer "
"acpica and changes specific to running this avocado QEMU tests using bits. "
"The author of this document is the sole maintainer of the QEMU fork of bios "
"bits repo."

"``acpi-bits.py``: This is the main python avocado test script that generates "
"a biosbits iso. It then spawns a QEMU VM with it, collects the log and "
"reports test failures. This is the script one would be interested in if they "
"wanted to add or change some component of the log parsing, add a new command "
"line to alter how QEMU is spawned etc. Test writers typically would not need "
"to modify this script unless they wanted to enhance or change the log "
"parsing for their tests. In order to enable debugging, you can set **V=1** "
"environment variable. This enables verbose mode for the test and also dumps "

"This directory contains biosbits python based tests that are run from within "
"the biosbits environment in the spawned VM. New additions of test cases can "
"be made in the appropriate test file. For example, new acpi tests can go "
"into testacpi.py2 and one would call testsuite.add_test() to register the "
"new test so that it gets executed as a part of the ACPI tests. It might be "
"occasionally necessary to disable some subtests or add a new test that "
"belongs to a test suite not already present in this directory. To do this, "
