"The guest loader is similar to the ``generic-loader`` although it is aimed "
"at a particular use case of loading hypervisor guests. This is useful for "
"debugging hypervisors without having to jump through the hoops of firmware "
"and boot-loaders."

"In the above example the Xen hypervisor is loaded by the -kernel parameter "
