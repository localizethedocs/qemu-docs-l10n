"SEV is an extension to the AMD-V architecture which supports running "
"encrypted virtual machines (VMs) under the control of KVM. Encrypted VMs "
"have their pages (code and data) secured such that only the guest itself has "
"access to the unencrypted version. Each encrypted VM is associated with a "
"unique encryption key; if its data is accessed by a different entity using a "
"different key the encrypted guests data will be incorrectly decrypted, "
"leading to unintelligible data."

msgid ""
"Key management for this feature is handled by a separate processor known as "
"the AMD secure processor (AMD-SP), which is present in AMD SOCs. Firmware "
"running inside the AMD-SP provides commands to support a common VM "
"lifecycle. This includes commands for launching, snapshotting, migrating and "
"debugging the encrypted guest. These SEV commands can be issued via "
"KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP ioctls."

"Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Encrypted State (SEV-ES) builds on the SEV "
"support to additionally protect the guest register state. In order to allow "
"a hypervisor to perform functions on behalf of a guest, there is "
"architectural support for notifying a guest's operating system when certain "
"types of VMEXITs are about to occur. This allows the guest to selectively "
"share information with the hypervisor to satisfy the requested function."

"Boot images (such as bios) must be encrypted before a guest can be booted. "
"The ``MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP`` ioctl provides commands to encrypt the images: "
"``LAUNCH_START``, ``LAUNCH_UPDATE_DATA``, ``LAUNCH_MEASURE`` and "
