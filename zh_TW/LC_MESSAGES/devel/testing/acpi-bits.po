"Biosbits is a software written by Josh Triplett that can be downloaded from "
"https://biosbits.org/. The github codebase can be found `here <https://"
"github.com/biosbits/bits/tree/master>`__. It is a software that executes the "
"bios components such as acpi and smbios tables directly through acpica bios "
"interpreter (a freely available C based library written by Intel, "
"downloadable from https://acpica.org/ and is included with biosbits) without "
"an operating system getting involved in between. Bios-bits has python "
"integration with grub so actual routines that executes bios components can "
"be written in python instead of bash-ish (grub's native scripting language). "
"There are several advantages to directly testing the bios in a real physical "
"machine or in a VM as opposed to indirectly discovering bios issues through "
"the operating system (the OS). Operating systems tend to bypass bios "
"problems and hide them from the end user. We have more control of what we "
"wanted to test and how by being as close to the bios on a running system as "
"possible without a complicated software component such as an operating "
"system coming in between. Another issue is that we cannot exercise bios "
"components such as ACPI and SMBIOS without being in the highest hardware "
"privilege level, ring 0 for example in case of x86. Since the OS executes "
"from ring 0 whereas normal user land software resides in unprivileged ring "
"3, operating system must be modified in order to write our test routines "
"that exercise and test the bios. This is not possible in all cases. Lastly, "
"test frameworks and routines are preferably written using a high level "
"scripting language such as python. OSes and OS modules are generally written "
"using low level languages such as C and low level assembly machine language. "
"Writing test routines in a low level language makes things more cumbersome. "
"These and other reasons makes using bios-bits very attractive for testing "
"bioses. More details on the inspiration for developing biosbits and its real "
"life uses were presented `at Plumbers in 2011 <Plumbers_>`__ and `at Linux."
"conf.au in 2012 <Linux.conf.au_>`__."

"``test_acpi_bits.py``: This is the main python functional test script that "
"generates a biosbits iso. It then spawns a QEMU VM with it, collects the log "
"and reports test failures. This is the script one would be interested in if "
"they wanted to add or change some component of the log parsing, add a new "
"command line to alter how QEMU is spawned etc. Test writers typically would "
"not need to modify this script unless they wanted to enhance or change the "
"log parsing for their tests. In order to enable debugging, you can set "
"**V=1** environment variable. This enables verbose mode for the test and "
"also dumps the entire log from bios bits and more information in case "
"failure happens. You can also set **BITS_DEBUG=1** to turn on debug mode. It "
"will enable verbose logs and also retain the temporary work directory the "
"test used for you to inspect and run the specific commands manually."

"This directory contains biosbits python based tests that are run from within "
"the biosbits environment in the spawned VM. New additions of test cases can "
"be made in the appropriate test file. For example, new acpi tests can go "
"into testacpi.py2 and one would call testsuite.add_test() to register the "
"new test so that it gets executed as a part of the ACPI tests. It might be "
"occasionally necessary to disable some subtests or add a new test that "
