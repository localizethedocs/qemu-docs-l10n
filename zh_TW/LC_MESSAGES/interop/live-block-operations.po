"QEMU Block Layer currently (as of QEMU 2.9) supports four major kinds of "
"live block device jobs -- stream, commit, mirror, and backup.  These can be "
"used to manipulate disk image chains to accomplish certain tasks, namely: "
"live copy data from backing files into overlays; shorten long disk image "
"chains by merging data from overlays into backing files; live synchronize "
"data from a disk image chain (including current active disk) to another "
"target image; and point-in-time (and incremental) backups of a block "
