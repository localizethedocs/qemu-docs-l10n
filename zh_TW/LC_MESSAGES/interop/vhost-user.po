"This protocol is aiming to complement the ``ioctl`` interface used to "
"control the vhost implementation in the Linux kernel. It implements the "
"control plane needed to establish virtqueue sharing with a user space "
"process on the same host. It uses communication over a Unix domain socket to "
"share file descriptors in the ancillary data of the message."

"The protocol defines 2 sides of the communication, *master* and *slave*. "
