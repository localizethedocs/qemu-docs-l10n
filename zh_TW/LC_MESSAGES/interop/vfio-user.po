"vfio-user is a protocol that allows a device to be emulated in a separate "
"process outside of a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). vfio-user devices "
"consist of a generic VFIO device type, living inside the VMM, which we call "
"the client, and the core device implementation, living outside the VMM, "
"which we call the server."

"VFIO is a mature and stable API, backed by an extensively used framework. "
"The existing VFIO client implementation in QEMU (``qemu/hw/vfio/``) can be "
"largely re-used, though there is nothing in this specification that requires "
"that particular implementation. None of the VFIO kernel modules are required "
"for supporting the protocol, on either the client or server side. Some "
"source definitions in VFIO are re-used for vfio-user."

"The main idea is to allow a virtual device to function in a separate process "
"in the same host over a UNIX domain socket. A UNIX domain socket "

"Other socket types could be used which allow the server to run in a separate "

"Theoretically the underlying transport does not necessarily have to be a "
"socket, however we do not examine such alternatives. In this protocol "

"for the other two types of sockets without considering performance "
"implications."

"VFIO is a framework that allows a physical device to be securely passed "
"through to a user space process; the device-specific kernel driver does not "
"drive the device at all.  Typically, the user space process is a VMM and the "
"device is passed through to it in order to achieve high performance. VFIO "
"provides an API and the required functionality in the kernel. QEMU has "
"adopted VFIO to allow a guest to directly access physical devices, instead "
"of emulating them in software."

"vfio-user reuses the core VFIO concepts defined in its API, but implements "
"them as messages to be sent over a socket. It does not change the kernel-"
"based VFIO in any way, in fact none of the VFIO kernel modules need to be "
"loaded to use vfio-user. It is also possible for the client to concurrently "
"use the current kernel-based VFIO for one device, and vfio-user for another "

"The following sections describe the set of messages that implement the vfio-"
"user interface over a socket. In many cases, the messages are analogous to "
"data structures used in the ``ioctl()`` implementation. Messages derived "
"from the ``ioctl()`` will have a name derived from the ``ioctl()`` command "
"name.  E.g., the ``VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` ``ioctl()`` command becomes a "
"``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` message.  The purpose of this reuse is to "

"this requirement e.g. by running two independent request processing threads "
"that can internally operate synchronously. It is expected that this is "
