msgid ""
"The ivshmem-flat device is meant to be used on machines that lack a PCI bus, "
"making them unsuitable for the use of the traditional ivshmem device modeled "
"as a PCI device. Machines like those with a Cortex-M MCU are good candidates "
"to use the ivshmem-flat device. Also, since the flat version maps the "
"control and status registers directly to the memory, it requires a quite "
"tiny \"device driver\" to interact with other VMs, which is useful in some "
"RTOSes, like Zephyr, which usually run on constrained resource targets."

"Similar to the ivshmem device, the ivshmem-flat device supports both peer "
"notification via HW interrupts and Inter-VM shared memory. This allows the "
"device to be used together with the traditional ivshmem, enabling "
"communication between, for instance, an aarch64 VM  (using the traditional "
"ivshmem device and running Linux), and an arm VM (using the ivshmem-flat "
"device and running Zephyr instead)."

"The ivshmem-flat device does not support the use of a ``memdev`` option (see "
"ivshmem.rst for more details). It relies on the ivshmem server to create and "
"distribute the proper shared memory file descriptor and the eventfd(s) to "
"notify (interrupt) the peers. Therefore, to use this device, it is always "
"necessary to have an ivshmem server up and running for proper device "
"creation."

#: ../../../system/devices/ivshmem-flat.rst:25
msgid ""
"Although the ivshmem-flat supports both peer notification (interrupts) and "
"shared memory, the interrupt mechanism is optional. If no input IRQ is "
"specified for the device it is disabled, preventing the VM from notifying or "
"being notified by other VMs (a warning will be displayed to the user to "
"inform the IRQ mechanism is disabled). The shared memory region is always "
"present."

"The MMRs (INTRMASK, INTRSTATUS, IVPOSITION, and DOORBELL registers) offsets "
"at the MMR region, and their functions, follow the ivshmem spec, so they "
"work exactly as in the ivshmem PCI device (see ./specs/ivshmem-spec.txt)."
