"Originally, KVM-HV was only available when running on a PowerNV platform (a."

"As KVM-HV has access to privileged instructions, guests that use a lot of "

"to specify an embedded PPC CPU for the guest with KVM-HV. However, there is "
"at least the possibility to run the guest in a backward-compatibility mode "
