"In system mode emulation, it's possible to create a VM in a paused state "

"However, at the ``-S`` pause point, it's impossible to configure options "
"that affect initial VM creation (like: ``-smp``/``-m``/``-numa`` ...) or "
"cold plug devices. The experimental ``--preconfig`` command line option "
"allows pausing QEMU before the initial VM creation, in a \"preconfig\" "
"state, where additional queries and configuration can be performed via QMP "
"before moving on to the resulting configuration startup. In the preconfig "
"state, QEMU only allows a limited set of commands over the QMP monitor, "
"where the commands do not depend on an initialized machine, including but "
"not limited to:"
