"``nitro-enclave`` is a machine type which emulates an *AWS nitro enclave* "
"virtual machine. `AWS nitro enclaves`_ is an Amazon EC2 feature that allows "
"creating isolated execution environments, called enclaves, from Amazon EC2 "
"instances which are used for processing highly sensitive data. Enclaves have "
"no persistent storage and no external networking. The enclave VMs are based "
"on Firecracker microvm with a vhost-vsock device for communication with the "
"parent EC2 instance that spawned it and a Nitro Secure Module (NSM) device "
"for cryptographic attestation. The parent instance VM always has CID 3 while "
"the enclave VM gets a dynamic CID. Enclaves use an EIF (`Enclave Image "
"Format`_) file which contains the necessary kernel, cmdline and ramdisk(s) "
"to boot."

"In QEMU, ``nitro-enclave`` is a machine type based on ``microvm`` similar to "
"how AWS nitro enclaves look like a `Firecracker`_ microvm. This is useful "
"for local testing of EIF files using QEMU instead of running real AWS Nitro "
"Enclaves which can be difficult for debugging due to its roots in security. "
"The vsock device emulation is done using vhost-user-vsock which means "
"another process that can do the userspace emulation, like `vhost-device-"
"vsock`_ from rust-vmm crate, must be run alongside nitro-enclave for the "
"vsock communication to work."
