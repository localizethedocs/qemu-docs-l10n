"QEMU supports the emulation of a large number of devices from peripherals "
"such network cards and USB devices to integrated systems on a chip (SoCs). "
"Configuration of these is often a source of confusion so it helps to have an "
"understanding of some of the terms used to describes devices within QEMU."

"A device front end is how a device is presented to the guest. The type of "
"device presented should match the hardware that the guest operating system "
"is expecting to see. All devices can be specified with the ``--device`` "
"command line option. Running QEMU with the command line options ``--device "
"help`` will list all devices it is aware of. Using the command line ``--"
"device foo,help`` will list the additional configuration options available "
"for that device."

"A front end is often paired with a back end, which describes how the host's "

msgid ""
"Most devices will exist on a BUS of some sort. Depending on the machine "
"model you choose (``-M foo``) a number of buses will have been automatically "
"created. In most cases the BUS a device is attached to can be inferred, for "
"example PCI devices are generally automatically allocated to the next free "
"address of first PCI bus found. However in complicated configurations you "
"can explicitly specify what bus (``bus=ID``) a device is attached to along "
"with its address (``addr=N``)."

"Some devices, for example a PCI SCSI host controller, will add an additional "
"buses to the system that other devices can be attached to. A hypothetical "
"chain of devices might look like:"

"which would be a bar device (with the ID of baz) which is attached to the "
"first foo bus (foo.0) at address 1. The foo device which provides that bus "

msgid "Device Back End"
msgstr "裝置後端"

#: ../../../system/device-emulation.rst:56
msgid ""
"The back end describes how the data from the emulated device will be "
"processed by QEMU. The configuration of the back end is usually specific to "
"the class of device being emulated. For example serial devices will be "
"backed by a ``--chardev`` which can redirect the data to a file or socket or "
"some other system. Storage devices are handled by ``--blockdev`` which will "
"specify how blocks are handled, for example being stored in a qcow2 file or "
"accessing a raw host disk partition. Back ends can sometimes be stacked to "
"implement features like snapshots."

#: ../../../system/device-emulation.rst:66

"While the choice of back end is generally transparent to the guest, there "

msgid "Device Pass Through"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../system/device-emulation.rst:73
msgid ""
"Device pass through is where the device is actually given access to the "
"underlying hardware. This can be as simple as exposing a single USB device "
"on the host system to the guest or dedicating a video card in a PCI slot to "
"the exclusive use of the guest."
