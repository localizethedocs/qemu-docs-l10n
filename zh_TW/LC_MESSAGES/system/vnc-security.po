"The VNC protocol has limited support for password based authentication. "
"Since the protocol limits passwords to 8 characters it should not be "
"considered to provide high security. The password can be fairly easily brute-"
"forced by a client making repeat connections. For this reason, a VNC server "
"using password authentication should be restricted to only listen on the "
"loopback interface or UNIX domain sockets. Password authentication is not "
"supported when operating in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode as it requires the "
"use of the DES cipher. Password authentication is requested with the "
"``password`` option, and then once QEMU is running the password is set with "
"the monitor. Until the monitor is used to set the password all clients will "
"be rejected."

"The QEMU VNC server also implements the VeNCrypt extension allowing use of "

"The use of x509 certificates is strongly recommended, because TLS on its own "
"is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Basic x509 certificate support "
"provides a secure session, but no authentication. This allows any client to "
"connect, and provides an encrypted session."

"If the TLS option is enabled for VNC, then it will provide session "

"of security by modern standards. Previous versions of QEMU referred to the "
"DIGEST-MD5 mechanism, however, it has multiple serious flaws described in "
"detail in RFC 6331 and thus should never be used any more. The SCRAM-SHA-256 "
"mechanism provides a simple username/password auth facility similar to "
"DIGEST-MD5, but does not support session encryption, so can only be used in "
