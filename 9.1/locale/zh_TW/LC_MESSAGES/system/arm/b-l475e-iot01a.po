"The B-L475E-IOT01A IoT Node uses the STM32L475VG SoC which is based on ARM "
"Cortex-M4F core. It is part of STMicroelectronics :doc:`STM32 boards </"
"system/arm/stm32>` and more specifically the STM32L4 ultra-low power series. "
"The STM32L4x5 chip runs at up to 80 MHz and integrates 128 KiB of SRAM and "
"up to 1MiB of Flash. The B-L475E-IOT01A board namely features 64 Mibit QSPI "
"Flash, BT, WiFi and RF connectivity, USART, I2C, SPI, CAN and USB OTG, as "
"well as a variety of sensors."
