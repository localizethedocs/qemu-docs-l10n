"In general features are intended to be supported indefinitely once "

"will be listed in this section. The feature will remain functional for the "
"release in which it was deprecated and one further release. After these two "
"releases, the feature is liable to be removed. Deprecated features may also "
"generate warnings on the console when QEMU starts up, or if activated via a "
"monitor command, however, this is not a mandatory requirement."

msgid ""
"As a special exception to this general timeframe, rather than have an "
"indefinite lifetime, versioned machine types are only intended to be "
"supported for a period of 6 years, equivalent to 18 QEMU releases. All "
"versioned machine types will be automatically marked deprecated after an "
"initial 3 years (9 QEMU releases) has passed, and will then be deleted after "
"a further 3 year period has passed. It is recommended that a deprecated "
"machine type is only used for incoming migrations and restore of saved "
"state, for pre-existing VM deployments. They should be scheduled for "
"updating to a newer machine type during an appropriate service window. Newly "
"deployed VMs should exclusively use a non-deprecated machine type, with use "
"of the most recent version highly recommended. Non-versioned machine types "

"Previous versions of QEMU never changed existing CPU models in ways that "
"introduced additional host software or hardware requirements to the VM.  "
"This allowed management software to safely change the machine type of an "
"existing VM without introducing new requirements (\"runnability "
"guarantee\").  This prevented CPU models from being updated to include CPU "
"vulnerability mitigations, leaving guests vulnerable in the default "
"configuration."

"The CPU model runnability guarantee won't apply anymore to existing CPU "
"models.  Management software that needs runnability guarantees must resolve "
"the CPU model aliases using the ``alias-of`` field returned by the ``query-"
"cpu-definitions`` QMP command."

"While those guarantees are kept, the return value of ``query-cpu-"
"definitions`` will have existing CPU model aliases point to a version that "
"doesn't break runnability guarantees (specifically, version 1 of those CPU "
"models).  In future QEMU versions, aliases will point to newer CPU model "
"versions depending on the machine type, so management software must resolve "
"CPU model aliases before starting a virtual machine."
