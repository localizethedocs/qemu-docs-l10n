"UADK is a general-purpose user space accelerator framework that uses shared "
"virtual addressing (SVA) to provide a unified programming interface for "
"hardware acceleration of cryptographic and compression algorithms."

"UADK includes Unified/User-space-access-intended Accelerator Framework "

"Currently, HiSilicon Kunpeng hardware accelerators have been registered with "
"UACCE. Through the UADK framework, users can run cryptographic and "
"compression algorithms using hardware accelerators instead of CPUs, freeing "
"up CPU computing power and improving computing performance."

"UADK consists of UACCE, vendors' drivers, and an algorithm layer. UADK "
"requires the hardware accelerator to support SVA, and the operating system "
"to support IOMMU and SVA. Hardware accelerators from different vendors are "
"registered as different character devices with UACCE by using kernel-mode "
"drivers of the vendors. A user can access the hardware accelerators by "
"performing user-mode operations on the character devices."
