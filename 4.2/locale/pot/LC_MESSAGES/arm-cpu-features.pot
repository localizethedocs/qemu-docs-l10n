"CPU features are optional features that a CPU of supporting type may choose "
"to implement or not.  In QEMU, optional CPU features have corresponding "
"boolean CPU proprieties that, when enabled, indicate that the feature is "
"implemented, and, conversely, when disabled, indicate that it is not "
"implemented. An example of an ARM CPU feature is the Performance Monitoring "
"Unit (PMU).  CPU types such as the Cortex-A15 and the Cortex-A57, which "
"respectively implement ARM architecture reference manuals ARMv7-A and ARMv8-"
"A, may both optionally implement PMUs.  For example, if a user wants to use "
"a Cortex-A15 without a PMU, then the `-cpu` parameter should contain "
"`pmu=off` on the QEMU command line, i.e. `-cpu cortex-a15,pmu=off`."

"As not all CPU types support all optional CPU features, then whether or not "
"a CPU property exists depends on the CPU type.  For example, CPUs that "
"implement the ARMv8-A architecture reference manual may optionally support "
"the AArch32 CPU feature, which may be enabled by disabling the `aarch64` CPU "
"property.  A CPU type such as the Cortex-A15, which does not implement ARMv8-"
"A, will not have the `aarch64` CPU property."

"using the KVM accelerator and when running on a host CPU type that supports "

"Named CPU models generally do not work with KVM.  There are a few cases that "
"do work, e.g. using the named CPU model `cortex-a57` with KVM on a seattle "
"host, but mostly if KVM is enabled the `host` CPU type must be used.  This "
"means the guest is provided all the same CPU features as the host CPU type "
"has.  And, for this reason, the `host` CPU type should enable all CPU "
"features that the host has by default.  Indeed it's even a bit strange to "
"allow disabling CPU features that the host has when using the `host` CPU "
"type, but in the absence of CPU models it's the best we can do if we want to "
"launch guests without all the host's CPU features enabled."

"Enabling KVM also affects the `query-cpu-model-expansion` QMP command.  The "
"affect is not only limited to specific features, as pointed out in example "
"(3) of \"CPU Feature Probing\", but also to which CPU types may be expanded. "
"When KVM is enabled, only the `max`, `host`, and current CPU type may be "
"expanded.  This restriction is necessary as it's not possible to know all "
"CPU types that may work with KVM, but it does impose a small risk of users "
"experiencing unexpected errors.  For example on a seattle, as mentioned "
"above, the `cortex-a57` CPU type is also valid when KVM is enabled. "
"Therefore a user could use the `host` CPU type for the current type, but "
"then attempt to query `cortex-a57`, however that query will fail with our "
"restrictions.  This shouldn't be an issue though as management layers and "
"users have been preferring the `host` CPU type for use with KVM for quite "
"some time.  Additionally, if the KVM-enabled QEMU instance running on a "
"seattle host is using the `cortex-a57` CPU type, then querying `cortex-a57` "
